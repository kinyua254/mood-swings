    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="life">I believe that immortality lies in the legacies we leave behind. </p>
    <p class="life">What`s the use of living if you die and don`t leave any memories with the living.</p>
    <p>When <em>young</em> we all believed that <span class = "beginning"> education is the key</span>. That is how i started my schooling and went to primary school at <span class = "beginning">Kathigiri primary school</span> and went to the prestigious <span class = "beginning">Mang`u High school </span>for my highschool. Later i went to campus at MMU and soon deffered to come and learning coding practically instead of theoretically like they used to teach us. I really do believe that the transition and the leap of faith into <span class = "Moringa">MoringaSchool</span> will be worth it and so far so good.</p>
